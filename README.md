Step 1 : Create Jar file for this program.
Step 2 : Open terminal in Sprak evniroment.
step 3 : goto in bin folder of spark.
step 4 : run script spark-submit with the jar path given as arugment.
step 5 : done

This way you can create the Co-Occurance matrix.

To create the jar follow the followig steps:

Step 2: write sbt command.
Step 3: write package command.
step4 : done

DataFormat folder contain the program for the formating and cleaning trainning dataset. It will format data userwise. All user data can be combine togther
